Forked from [here](https://github.com/skyfire-xyz/external-stripe-embed) this repo demonstrates a worker-friendly vanilla version of a Skyfire Stripe top-up button allowing an easy for users to top-up paying for agent work with real money.

TODO:

- Integrate with sponsorflare/flarefare in a way that the skyfire API Key comes from the backend, and the user just sees the button.
